# chrome-bgcolor

Chrome extension that changes bgcolor to a comfortable shade of palegreen: #C3E8C8.  
Created by Yi Xiao.

There are two versions:  
**chrome-bg-only**: changes general backgrounds and text fields to palegreen.  
**chrome-bg-div**: also overwrites all div colors. 

If the first one has no effect over a certain webpage, try the one overwriting divs.  
However be aware that a small number of webpages might lose some functionality when divs are altered.

How to install:

Download the **.crx** file.
Go to **chrome://extensions/**.  
Check the box for **Developer mode**.  
Drag the **.crx** file onto the page.  
Click **Add extension** when prompted.

Or:  
Download the entire folder containing a **.css** and a **.json** file.   
Go to **chrome://extensions/**.  
Check the box for **Developer mode**.  
Click **Load unpacked extension...**.  
Locate the downloaded folder and click **Select**.
